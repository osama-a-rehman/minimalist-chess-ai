## 1) Use and understand Git:

I have used Git as the Version Control system for this project and I understood what the various git commands do. The following commands are the ones that I used the most while working on the project.

1) <b>`git add <FILES_HERE>`</b>: I used this command to add untracked files by git to the staging area.

2) <b>`git commit -m <MESSAGE_HERE>`</b>: I used this command to commit the files that are currently in the git staging area.

3) <b>`git fetch`</b>: As I was setting up the CD pipeline through github, the commits that I made from there weren't accessible in my local/working repository, unless I run this command to see if there are any changes made to the remote repository.

4) <b>`git stash create <MESSAGE_HERE>`</b>: I used this command to stash my changes in the local repository before pulling the changes that I made from github, as git doesn't allow pulling some changes from remote repository unless the current working repository is clean and have no uncommited changes.

5) <b>`git pull --rebase`</b>: I used this command to pull the changes from the remote repository. There are two ways to pull the changes from remote origin, one is to merge and the other is to rebase. Rebasing carries out the pull operation without creating a separate merge commit, whereas Merging creates a commit for merge. I like to keep my change history clean from merge commits therefore I use the `--rebase` flag when pulling remote changes.

## 2) UML Diagrams:
1) <b>Class Diagram</b>: A UML Class diagram is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects. The following graphic shows the UML Class Diagram of Minimalist Chess AI project.

2) <b>Sequence Diagram</b>: A UML Sequence diagram shows object interactions arranged in time sequence. It depicts the objects involved in the scenario and the sequence of messages exchanged between the objects needed to carry out the functionality of scenario. The following graphic shows the UML Sequence Diagram of Minimalist Chess AI project.

3) <b>State Diagram</b>: A UML State diagram is a diagram used in computer science to describe the behavior of a system considering all the possible states of an object when an event occurs. The following graphic shows the UML State Diagram of Minimalist Chess AI project.

## 5) Clean Code Development:
In order to write Clean Code, generally I keep in mind `SOLID` principles put forward by <b>Robert C. Martin</b>, `DRY` principle which means "Don't repeat yourself" and `KISS` meaning "Keep it super simple". To be specific, I use following Cheatsheet to make sure that the code I have written is Clean Code.

Moreover, the following points show how the code I've written as part of this project is Clean Code.
1) <b></b>

## 8) Continous Integration/Continous Delivery:

The CI/CD pipeline can be found here [CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/osama-a-rehman/minimalist-chess-ai/blob/681e02da5f9b81c6f5f56b224b063e8283ad22e7/.github/workflows/cd.yml). The CI/CD pipeline runs when a push or pull request is made to the "main" branch. It then carries out the following steps:

1) <b>Set up JDK 11</b>: Setup the ubuntu-20 machine with JDK 11, node.js and npm installed in it.

2) <b>Setup Project</b>: It initializes the project by running the initialize goal of maven which cleans the npm cache, and run npm install so that all the dependencies of the project are available for building it.

3)  <b>Build Project</b>: It runs the compile phase of maven, and the npm plugin attached on this phase in turn runs the command for building the angular project.

4) <b>Test Project</b>: It runs the test phase of maven, the built project in the previous stage is tested in this stage.

5) <b>Package production build for deployment</b>: It runs the package phase of maven, if the previous stage of the CD pipeline passes, then in this stage, the production build of the project is created without running the tests by passing the -DskipTests argument in the maven command (as the tests have already passed in the previous stage, therefore running tests again aren't necessary).

6) <b>Deploy Project</b>: This stage of the pipeline is left unimplemented, but it is intended to deploy the application built for production in the last stage to be deployed on a server.


## 9) IDE Shortcuts:

My favourite IDE is Intellij IDEA and I used it to develop this project. Five of my favourite shortcuts of the IDE and what they do are as follows:

1) <b>Alt+Enter</b>: It's one of the most useful shortcuts of the IDE. This shortcut behaves differently based on the line which has the cursor.
   On the line with an error, pressing Alt+Enter shows the list of suggested fixes for the problem.
   On the line with a warning, pressing Alt+Enter shows the list of suggestions to remove the warning.
   On any other line, pressing Alt+Enter shows us Intention Actions available in the current context, e.g. add static imports in Java when a static resource is accessed on the line.

2) <b>F2</b>: Using F2, you can jump across errors and warning in the current file making it convenient to have a look at errors or warnings in the file instead of navigating across them using the mouse scroll.

3) <b>Shift+Shift</b>: Double pressing the Shift key opens a search box that lets you search for anything across the project. Typing in the search box, you can see results from classes, files, symbols and actions.

4) <b>Shift+F6</b>: Shift+F6 is the shortcut for Rename Refactoring to change names of symbols, files, directories, packages, modules and all the references to them throughout the project.

5) <b>Alt+F7</b>: Pressing Alt+F7 shows the usages of what is under the cursor across the project. For example, pressing Alt+F7 on the interface name, the search window will show all the places that the interface is used whether itâ€™s a field declaration or a class that implements this interface.

## 11) Functional Programming
1) <b>Only final data structures</b>: I've used `final` or `readonly` gameClient in the [Board Component](https://github.com/osama-a-rehman/minimalist-chess-ai/blob/0d404c368e846230fb2cb8b448d33429a8d41c77/src/main/java/minimalist-chess-ai/src/app/board/board.component.ts#L15) as it's never reassigned after initial assignment. The other 4 attributes in the project are mutable so they have to be kept non-final.

2) <b>Side effect free functions</b>: All the utility functions are side-effect free i.e. they return the same value with same parameters everytime they are called. The examples of side-effect free functions from the project are: 
a) [AIUtil#calculateBestMove(gameClient, currentMove, depth): string](https://github.com/osama-a-rehman/minimalist-chess-ai/blob/0d404c368e846230fb2cb8b448d33429a8d41c77/src/main/java/minimalist-chess-ai/src/app/board/utils/ai.util.ts#L6): It returns the notated best move for the player whose current move it is, by evaluating the position using minimax algorithm at a certain depth passed as parameters.
b) [AIUtil#minimax(gameClient, depth, alpha, beta, isMaximizing): number](https://github.com/osama-a-rehman/minimalist-chess-ai/blob/0d404c368e846230fb2cb8b448d33429a8d41c77/src/main/java/minimalist-chess-ai/src/app/board/utils/ai.util.ts#L35): It performs the minimax algorithm on the chess position pointed by the game client and tries to minimize or maximize the evaluation and choose the best move accordingly. 
c) [AIUtil#evaluateBoard(gameClient, currentMove): number](https://github.com/osama-a-rehman/minimalist-chess-ai/blob/0d404c368e846230fb2cb8b448d33429a8d41c77/src/main/java/minimalist-chess-ai/src/app/board/utils/ai.util.ts#L78): It returns the chess position's evaluation pointed by the game client.
d) [BoardUtil#getBoardFromGameClient(gameClient: any): Board](https://github.com/osama-a-rehman/minimalist-chess-ai/blob/0d404c368e846230fb2cb8b448d33429a8d41c77/src/main/java/minimalist-chess-ai/src/app/board/utils/board.util.ts#L14): It returns the board data type i.e. `Piece[][]` by mapping the chess position from the game client to this data type. It is used to show chess pieces and the board on the website's frontend.

The functions in the [BoardComponent](https://github.com/osama-a-rehman/minimalist-chess-ai/blob/0d404c368e846230fb2cb8b448d33429a8d41c77/src/main/java/minimalist-chess-ai/src/app/board/board.component.ts) are not side-effect free as they are used to mutate game state of the BoardComponent class.

3) <b>The use of higher-order functions</b>: I used a higher order function [getMiniMaxFn(isMaximizing: boolean): fn](https://github.com/osama-a-rehman/minimalist-chess-ai/blob/3710022f50b3aa2e8acdcac80c415c2479194cf5/src/main/java/minimalist-chess-ai/src/app/board/utils/ai.util.ts#L100) that returns either `Math.min` or `Math.max` function based on whether the minimax algorithm is maximizing or minizing the value. Its usage can be found here: [getMiniMaxFn()'s usage](https://github.com/osama-a-rehman/minimalist-chess-ai/blob/3710022f50b3aa2e8acdcac80c415c2479194cf5/src/main/java/minimalist-chess-ai/src/app/board/utils/ai.util.ts#L50)

4) <b>Functions as parameters and return values</b>: All of the utility functions follow this approach they take parameters and based on the parameters, return the consistent value. These function can be found in [AiUtil](https://github.com/osama-a-rehman/minimalist-chess-ai/blob/main/src/main/java/minimalist-chess-ai/src/app/board/utils/ai.util.ts#L50) and [BoardUtil](https://github.com/osama-a-rehman/minimalist-chess-ai/blob/main/src/main/java/minimalist-chess-ai/src/app/board/utils/board.util.ts) classes.

5) <b>Use closures or anonymous functions</b>: I used closures on two places in the project. 
a) Firstly, I used a closure [here](https://github.com/osama-a-rehman/minimalist-chess-ai/blob/3710022f50b3aa2e8acdcac80c415c2479194cf5/src/main/java/minimalist-chess-ai/src/app/board/board.component.ts#L75) to map the valid moves in a particular position to starting and ending squares so that these squares can be highlighted on the board for user's assistance.
b) Secondly, I used a closure [here](https://github.com/osama-a-rehman/minimalist-chess-ai/blob/3710022f50b3aa2e8acdcac80c415c2479194cf5/src/main/java/minimalist-chess-ai/src/app/board/board.component.ts#L87). When the asynchronous evaluation for the best move is done by AI, this closure is called with the best move and this parameter of the closure is used to make the move suggested by AI on the board.
